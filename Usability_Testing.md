### Documentation

**Date**: 11/29

**Name of Who Tested**: Allie He

**Time**: 8:52PM

**5 Second test**

She said it felt “warm” and “caring” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort” for the design and the “Community” text in the call to action button. 

**Think out Loud** 

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* Described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and clicking “join the community” where it brings her to a sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup”
  * **Frustration**: Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons don’t take her anywhere
* Also saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage where it brings her to the same sign up page
   * **Frustration**: Described how she thought the two pages ("Sign Up" and "Join the Community") were very different because the buttons wording is very different
  * **Frustration**: When looking at the navigation bar, the “Community” section also looks like it would bring her to the same page as “join the community” call to action but it does not
  * **Frustration**: Yellow buttons on white background may be hard to see for her
  * **Frustration**: Hard to see the white words on the hero section because of background image in second design and also navigation menu words in yellow are hard to see (should not do that) 
* Described when scrolling down the home page how she saw the “Join the Community” call to action as well, and saw that if she signs up, she can get a free drink within a week; she had the same frustration though about making the button and text align more and both be about joining the family rather than community

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* She stated that she felt as though the text for “Join the Community” should be different from “Community” because it is very confusing because they both lead to different pages
* She then clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where she read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where she could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”
  * **Frustration**: Lend a hand button is not very visible since it is yellow and so is the text
* She also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when she clicked “Learn More” she would also see the community page

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page, she clicked “See Menu” and it took her to the menu page where she saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, she saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then she clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, she also said it was easy to tell where to check the menu, which is the button that says “Full Menu”

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* She scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page; also saw hours and location through scrolling
  * **Frustration**: She stated that it was weird how the “Hours and Location” section in the navigation bar is “Location and Hours” when she clicks on the page and when she scrolls down the home page

She also saw that every page link was able to be seen in the footer, as well as a sign up section 

**A/B Testing**

* She liked the hero section better for the second design where the image spans the whole screen
  * She liked the hero text of “Welcome to Cottage Comfort Cafe” rather than “Step into Cottage Comfort Cafe” and liked “Where every sip feels like home” rather than “Your Cozy Corner of Warmth and Flavor” (because it is more straightforward and understandable)
* Liked the navigation bar from first design for all pages, the one where the words are all black and the title of the website (or page you are on) is bolded and black instead of yellow, which is hard to see
* Liked the photo of the coffees around the table in the “Join the Community” section of the home page rather than lonely coffee photo in Design 2 because it shows more community; preferred the text stating: “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family” instead of “Become Part of Our Cozy Circle” because the latter feels more demanding and family seems more welcoming; for the description text, she liked “Sign up for our rewards program now, and enjoy a free coffee drink with your next order. This warm welcome offer is valid starting 7 days after your sign-up. Let the countdown to comfort begin!” rather than “Register for our loyalty rewards today, and delight in a complimentary coffee beverage on your subsequent visit. Embrace this heartfelt greeting deal, active 7 days post your registration. The journey to joyous warmth awaits!” because it was shorter and easier to read
* Liked testimonial text better in design 1 rather than design 2; design 2 text seemed too professional and hard to understand 
* Liked the first design’s testimonial layout and thought the second design’s background photo takes away the attention from the reviews
* Liked the first design for the “Nurturing the Community” section because the second design is hard to read because of the colors and the background image
* Liked the overall layout of elements in Design 1. Design 2 has the Testimonials, Nurturing the Community, and the Join the Community sections all piled together and it looks off
* Liked the first design for location and hours as well; second design was not visually pleasing and the location and hours text being unaligned did not look good
* For the Signup Page, she liked the white on white design of the first design, but liked the white input boxes of the second design better (since the yellow ones seemed odd)
* For the menu page, she liked the first design’s layout in regards to the specialty drinks being on the white background rather than a brown background (because the white aligns with the design of the menu in the home page); however she also liked the second design’s regular menu layout more, as it divided everything better and make items look more clear
* Liked the layout and overall design, text, and photos of the first design for the Community Page, other than the “lend a hand” button, which is hard to see
