## First Design Session 1

### Designs Tested
**[First Figma Designs](First_Figma_Designs.md)**

### Documentation

**Date**: 11/29

**Name of Who Tested**: Allie He

**Time**: 8:52PM

**5 Second test**

She said it felt “warm” and “caring” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort” for the design and the “Community” text in the call to action button. 

**Think out Loud** 

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* Described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and clicking “join the community” where it brings her to a sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup”
  * **Frustration**: Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons don’t take her anywhere
    * **Fix**: Take the Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons away
* Also saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage where it brings her to the same sign up page
   * **Frustration**: Described how she thought the two pages ("Sign Up" and "Join the Community") were very different because the buttons wording is very different
     * **Fix**: Change the “Sign Up” button to say “Join Now” to make it align with the “Join our Family” button so it is clear they both bring one to the same page
  * **Frustration**: When looking at the navigation bar, the “Community” section also looks like it would bring her to the same page as “join the community” call to action but it does not
     * **Fix**: Changed call to action to say “Join our Family” instead of “Join the Community”, which separates it from the “Community” section of the page
  * **Frustration**: Yellow buttons on white background may be hard to see for her
     * **Fix**: For Design 1, added drop shadow to make buttons stand out more over white background in all pages and sections of website; for Design 2, changed buttons on white background to be purple so they can stand out (need to test again to see which option better)
  * **Frustration**: Hard to see the white words on the hero section because of background image in second design and also navigation menu words in yellow are hard to see (should not do that)
     * **Fix**: Made the transparency of the photo more transparent (40%) so that you can see the text better ; for Design 2, made words that are bolded in yellow to be purple (and more visible)
* Described when scrolling down the home page how she saw the “Join the Community” call to action as well, and saw that if she signs up, she can get a free drink within a week; she had the same frustration though about making the button and text align more and both be about joining the family rather than community
  * **Fix:** Changed that button as well from “Join the Community” to “Join our Family” to align with the header text more 

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* She stated that she felt as though the text for “Join the Community” should be different from “Community” because it is very confusing because they both lead to different pages
* She then clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where she read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where she could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”
  * **Frustration**: Lend a hand button is not very visible since it is yellow and so is the text
    * **Fix**: Delete lend a hand button, as it does not lead the user to anything anyways
* She also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when she clicked “Learn More” she would also see the community page

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page, she clicked “See Menu” and it took her to the menu page where she saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, she saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then she clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, she also said it was easy to tell where to check the menu, which is the button that says “Full Menu”

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* She scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page; also saw hours and location through scrolling
  * **Frustration**: She stated that it was weird how the “Hours and Location” section in the navigation bar is “Location and Hours” when she clicks on the page and when she scrolls down the home page
    * **Fix**: Change the header text to “Hours and Location”

She also saw that every page link was able to be seen in the footer, as well as a sign up section 

**A/B Testing**

* She liked the hero section better for the second design where the image spans the whole screen
  * She liked the hero text of “Welcome to Cottage Comfort Cafe” rather than “Step into Cottage Comfort Cafe” and liked “Where every sip feels like home” rather than “Your Cozy Corner of Warmth and Flavor” (because it is more straightforward and understandable)
    * **Fix**: Both designs now have the same hero image and layout, as well as the same text she chose that works better for the user
* Liked the navigation bar from first design for all pages, the one where the words are all black and the title of the website (or page you are on) is bolded and black instead of yellow, which is hard to see
  * **Fix**: Design 1 navigation bar stays the same, the second one is now purple instead of yellow to be more visible  
* Liked the photo of the coffees around the table in the “Join the Community” section of the home page rather than lonely coffee photo in Design 2 because it shows more community; preferred the text stating: “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family” instead of “Become Part of Our Cozy Circle” because the latter feels more demanding and family seems more welcoming; for the description text, she liked “Sign up for our rewards program now, and enjoy a free coffee drink with your next order. This warm welcome offer is valid starting 7 days after your sign-up. Let the countdown to comfort begin!” rather than “Register for our loyalty rewards today, and delight in a complimentary coffee beverage on your subsequent visit. Embrace this heartfelt greeting deal, active 7 days post your registration. The journey to joyous warmth awaits!” because it was shorter and easier to read
   * **Fix**: Kept image for design 1 but changed image to become more warmer and welcome for design 2
   * **Fix**: Changed Design 2 text from “Become Part of Our Cozy Circle”
   * **Fix**: Changed Design 2 text from:“Register for our loyalty rewards today, and delight in a complimentary coffee beverage on your subsequent visit. Embrace this heartfelt greeting deal, active 7 days post your registration. The journey to joyous warmth awaits!” to  “Sign up for our rewards program now, and enjoy a free coffee drink with your next order. This warm welcome offer is valid starting 7 days after your sign-up. Let the countdown to comfort begin!”
     * In the second design, added a division between the previous text and “Let the countdown to comfort begin!” (need to test whether the original or this new design is better)
* Liked testimonial text better in design 1 rather than design 2; design 2 text seemed too professional and hard to understand
  * **Fix**: Changed text in Design 2 from “Heartfelt Reflections from Our Cherished Guests” to something simpler and changed review text from: "Cottage Comfort Café is a peaceful haven providing a heartwarming sense of belonging and care with every cup” and "More than just great coffee, Cottage Comfort Café is where
our community comes together, like a big, happy family" and "The staff is amazing and the coffee is perfect. Every visit feels like a warm, comforting embrace" to “Cottage Comfort Café feels like a warm hug, with its cozy charm and friendly staff making every visit special” and “Cottage Comfort Café's serene ambiance and heavenly lattes make every visit a soothing retreat from the outside” and "Every visit to Cottage Comfort Café is a lovely experience, filled with care, comfort, and the perfect latte." 
* Liked the first design’s testimonial layout and thought the second design’s background photo takes away the attention from the reviews
  * **Fix**: Took away the background photo from Design 2
* Liked the first design for the “Nurturing the Community” section because the second design is hard to read because of the colors and the background image
  * **Fix**: Kept design 1 layout, changed design 2 layout to design 1
* Liked the overall layout of elements in Design 1. Design 2 has the Testimonials, Nurturing the Community, and the Join the Community sections all piled together and it looks off
  * **Fix**: Kept design 1 simple layout, changed design 2 layout to design 1
* Liked the first design for location and hours as well; second design was not visually pleasing and the location and hours text being unaligned did not look good
  * **Fix**:  Kept design 1 layout and changed design 2 to be similar but with the button in a different location (which will be tested)
* For the Signup Page, she liked the white on white design of the first design, but liked the white input boxes of the second design better (since the yellow ones seemed odd)
  * **Fix**: Made both designs have white on white design and white input boxes
* For the menu page, she liked the first design’s layout in regards to the specialty drinks being on the white background rather than a brown background (because the white aligns with the design of the menu in the home page); however she also liked the second design’s regular menu layout more, as it divided everything better and make items look more clear
  * **Fix**: Change the menu page for both designs to have these elements 
* Liked the layout and overall design, text, and photos of the first design for the Community Page, other than the “lend a hand” button, which is hard to see
  * **Fix**: changed both design layouts to be similar to that of the first design and took away the “lend a hand” button

## First Design Session 2

### Designs Tested
**[First Figma Designs](First_Figma_Designs.md)**

### Documentation

**Date**: 12/1

**Name of Who Tested**: Eryk Sklodowski

**Time**: 5:45PM

**5 Second test**

He said it felt “acceptable” and “friendly” and remembered “Welcome to Cottage Comfort”. 

**Think out Loud** 

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* Also described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and clicking “join the community” where it brings him to a sign up page where he inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup” (he also read the text above that stated that you get a free drink when signing up and a week to redeem, after 10 visits, and 50% off if recommend on socials). Saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage.
  * **Frustration**: Also mentioned how “Sign up” and “Join the Community” buttons seem like they would lead to different pages but don’t
     * **Fix**: stated in session 1
  * **Frustration**: Also mentioned when looking at the navigation bar, the “Community” section also looks like it would bring him to the same page as “join the community” call to action but it does not
     * **Fix**: stated in session 1 
* Also described when scrolling down the home page how he saw the “Join the Community” call to action as well, and saw that if he signs up, he can get a free drink within a week; he had the same frustration though about making the button and header text align more and both be about joining the family rather than community
  * **Fix**: stated in session 1
  * **Frustration**: Both headers for this section for both designs: “Become Part of this Cozy Circle” and “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family” are very long
    * **Fix**: Change the headers for both to: “Become Part of Our Family”

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* Clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where he read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where he could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”
  * **Frustration**: Lend a hand button is not very visible since it is yellow and so is the text; the lend a hand button also does not work or lead him anywhere
    * **Fix**: fixed in session 1
* He also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when he clicked the button to “Learn More” he would also see the community page
  * **Frustration**: Description for this section is very long
    * **Fix**: Shorten the description to: “At Cottage Comfort Café, we're committed to fostering meaningful initiatives that directly support and uplift the people in our community, reflecting the love and care we’ve received from every smiling face that walks through our doors.”

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page hero section, he clicked “See Menu” and it took him to the menu page where he saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, he saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then he clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, he clicked “Full Menu”

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* He scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them
  * **Frustration**: The reviews don’t really look like reviews from users, but rather quotes; they have no personality to them
    * **Fix**: Change the cards to have pictures attached to them to represent profile pictures, and with those profile photos are the names of the customers, their reviews, and proof they are a loyal customer 
  * **Frustration**: The header of this section is a bit confusing and has words some people may not understand (Patrons?)
    * **Fix**: Change header for both designs to : “Warm Words from Our Beloved Customers” 
  * **Frustration**: For Design 1, they are a bit too much like the background
    * **Fix**: Change background color for testimonials to a light gray instead of white

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page; also saw hours and location through scrolling

**A/B Testing**

Liked the same layouts, texts, and designs as the previous person 

Also mentioned that it was better to make sure that the design does not have a brown background for a section that is right above the footer, as it creates a weird white gap of nothing between the footer and end of the other brown section
