(Written on Google Docs and Transferred to Here)

## First Design Session 1

### Designs Tested
**[First Figma Designs](First_Figma_Designs.md)**

### Documentation

**Date**: 11/29

**Name of Who Tested**: Allie He

**Time**: 8:52PM

**5 Second test**

She said it felt “warm” and “caring” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort” for the design and the “Community” text in the call to action button. 

**Think out Loud** 

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* Described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and clicking “join the community” where it brings her to a sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup”
  * **Frustration**: Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons don’t take her anywhere
    * **Fix**: Take the Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons away
* Also saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage where it brings her to the same sign up page
   * **Frustration**: Described how she thought the two pages ("Sign Up" and "Join the Community") were very different because the buttons wording is very different
     * **Fix**: Change the “Sign Up” button to say “Join Now” to make it align with the “Join our Family” button so it is clear they both bring one to the same page
  * **Frustration**: When looking at the navigation bar, the “Community” section also looks like it would bring her to the same page as “join the community” call to action but it does not
     * **Fix**: Changed call to action to say “Join our Family” instead of “Join the Community”, which separates it from the “Community” section of the page
  * **Frustration**: Yellow buttons on white background may be hard to see for her
     * **Fix**: For Design 1, added drop shadow to make buttons stand out more over white background in all pages and sections of website; for Design 2, changed buttons on white background to be purple so they can stand out (need to test again to see which option better)
  * **Frustration**: Hard to see the white words on the hero section because of background image in second design and also navigation menu words in yellow are hard to see (should not do that)
     * **Fix**: Made the transparency of the photo more transparent (40%) so that you can see the text better ; for Design 2, made words that are bolded in yellow to be purple (and more visible)
* Described when scrolling down the home page how she saw the “Join the Community” call to action as well, and saw that if she signs up, she can get a free drink within a week; she had the same frustration though about making the button and text align more and both be about joining the family rather than community
  * **Fix:** Changed that button as well from “Join the Community” to “Join our Family” to align with the header text more 

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* She stated that she felt as though the text for “Join the Community” should be different from “Community” because it is very confusing because they both lead to different pages
* She then clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where she read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where she could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”
  * **Frustration**: Lend a hand button is not very visible since it is yellow and so is the text
    * **Fix**: Delete lend a hand button, as it does not lead the user to anything anyways
* She also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when she clicked “Learn More” she would also see the community page

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page, she clicked “See Menu” and it took her to the menu page where she saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, she saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then she clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, she also said it was easy to tell where to check the menu, which is the button that says “Full Menu”

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* She scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page; also saw hours and location through scrolling
  * **Frustration**: She stated that it was weird how the “Hours and Location” section in the navigation bar is “Location and Hours” when she clicks on the page and when she scrolls down the home page
    * **Fix**: Change the header text to “Hours and Location”

She also saw that every page link was able to be seen in the footer, as well as a sign up section 

**A/B Testing**

* She liked the hero section better for the second design where the image spans the whole screen
  * She liked the hero text of “Welcome to Cottage Comfort Cafe” rather than “Step into Cottage Comfort Cafe” and liked “Where every sip feels like home” rather than “Your Cozy Corner of Warmth and Flavor” (because it is more straightforward and understandable)
    * **Fix**: Both designs now have the same hero image and layout, as well as the same text she chose that works better for the user
* Liked the navigation bar from first design for all pages, the one where the words are all black and the title of the website (or page you are on) is bolded and black instead of yellow, which is hard to see
  * **Fix**: Design 1 navigation bar stays the same, the second one is now purple instead of yellow to be more visible  
* Liked the photo of the coffees around the table in the “Join the Community” section of the home page rather than lonely coffee photo in Design 2 because it shows more community; preferred the text stating: “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family” instead of “Become Part of Our Cozy Circle” because the latter feels more demanding and family seems more welcoming; for the description text, she liked “Sign up for our rewards program now, and enjoy a free coffee drink with your next order. This warm welcome offer is valid starting 7 days after your sign-up. Let the countdown to comfort begin!” rather than “Register for our loyalty rewards today, and delight in a complimentary coffee beverage on your subsequent visit. Embrace this heartfelt greeting deal, active 7 days post your registration. The journey to joyous warmth awaits!” because it was shorter and easier to read
   * **Fix**: Kept image for design 1 but changed image to become more warmer and welcome for design 2
   * **Fix**: Changed Design 2 text from “Become Part of Our Cozy Circle”
   * **Fix**: Changed Design 2 text from:“Register for our loyalty rewards today, and delight in a complimentary coffee beverage on your subsequent visit. Embrace this heartfelt greeting deal, active 7 days post your registration. The journey to joyous warmth awaits!” to  “Sign up for our rewards program now, and enjoy a free coffee drink with your next order. This warm welcome offer is valid starting 7 days after your sign-up. Let the countdown to comfort begin!”
     * In the second design, added a division between the previous text and “Let the countdown to comfort begin!” (need to test whether the original or this new design is better)
* Liked testimonial text better in design 1 rather than design 2; design 2 text seemed too professional and hard to understand
  * **Fix**: Changed text in Design 2 from “Heartfelt Reflections from Our Cherished Guests” to something simpler and changed review text from: "Cottage Comfort Café is a peaceful haven providing a heartwarming sense of belonging and care with every cup” and "More than just great coffee, Cottage Comfort Café is where
our community comes together, like a big, happy family" and "The staff is amazing and the coffee is perfect. Every visit feels like a warm, comforting embrace" to “Cottage Comfort Café feels like a warm hug, with its cozy charm and friendly staff making every visit special” and “Cottage Comfort Café's serene ambiance and heavenly lattes make every visit a soothing retreat from the outside” and "Every visit to Cottage Comfort Café is a lovely experience, filled with care, comfort, and the perfect latte." 
* Liked the first design’s testimonial layout and thought the second design’s background photo takes away the attention from the reviews
  * **Fix**: Took away the background photo from Design 2
* Liked the first design for the “Nurturing the Community” section because the second design is hard to read because of the colors and the background image
  * **Fix**: Kept design 1 layout, changed design 2 layout to design 1
* Liked the overall layout of elements in Design 1. Design 2 has the Testimonials, Nurturing the Community, and the Join the Community sections all piled together and it looks off
  * **Fix**: Kept design 1 simple layout, changed design 2 layout to design 1
* Liked the first design for location and hours as well; second design was not visually pleasing and the location and hours text being unaligned did not look good
  * **Fix**:  Kept design 1 layout and changed design 2 to be similar but with the button in a different location (which will be tested)
* For the Signup Page, she liked the white on white design of the first design, but liked the white input boxes of the second design better (since the yellow ones seemed odd)
  * **Fix**: Made both designs have white on white design and white input boxes
* For the menu page, she liked the first design’s layout in regards to the specialty drinks being on the white background rather than a brown background (because the white aligns with the design of the menu in the home page); however she also liked the second design’s regular menu layout more, as it divided everything better and make items look more clear
  * **Fix**: Change the menu page for both designs to have these elements 
* Liked the layout and overall design, text, and photos of the first design for the Community Page, other than the “lend a hand” button, which is hard to see
  * **Fix**: changed both design layouts to be similar to that of the first design and took away the “lend a hand” button

## First Design Session 2

### Designs Tested
**[First Figma Designs](First_Figma_Designs.md)**

### Documentation

**Date**: 12/1

**Name of Who Tested**: Eryk Sklodowski

**Time**: 5:45PM

**5 Second test**

He said it felt “acceptable” and “friendly” and remembered “Welcome to Cottage Comfort”. 

**Think out Loud** 

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* Also described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and clicking “join the community” where it brings him to a sign up page where he inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup” (he also read the text above that stated that you get a free drink when signing up and a week to redeem, after 10 visits, and 50% off if recommend on socials). Saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage.
  * **Frustration**: Also mentioned how “Sign up” and “Join the Community” buttons seem like they would lead to different pages but don’t
     * **Fix**: stated in session 1
  * **Frustration**: Also mentioned when looking at the navigation bar, the “Community” section also looks like it would bring him to the same page as “join the community” call to action but it does not
     * **Fix**: stated in session 1 
* Also described when scrolling down the home page how he saw the “Join the Community” call to action as well, and saw that if he signs up, he can get a free drink within a week; he had the same frustration though about making the button and header text align more and both be about joining the family rather than community
  * **Fix**: stated in session 1
  * **Frustration**: Both headers for this section for both designs: “Become Part of this Cozy Circle” and “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family” are very long
    * **Fix**: Change the headers for both to: “Become Part of Our Family”

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* Clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where he read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where he could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”
  * **Frustration**: Lend a hand button is not very visible since it is yellow and so is the text; the lend a hand button also does not work or lead him anywhere
    * **Fix**: fixed in session 1
* He also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when he clicked the button to “Learn More” he would also see the community page
  * **Frustration**: Description for this section is very long
    * **Fix**: Shorten the description to: “At Cottage Comfort Café, we're committed to fostering meaningful initiatives that directly support and uplift the people in our community, reflecting the love and care we’ve received from every smiling face that walks through our doors.”

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page hero section, he clicked “See Menu” and it took him to the menu page where he saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, he saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then he clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, he clicked “Full Menu”

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* He scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them
  * **Frustration**: The reviews don’t really look like reviews from users, but rather quotes; they have no personality to them
    * **Fix**: Change the cards to have pictures attached to them to represent profile pictures, and with those profile photos are the names of the customers, their reviews, and proof they are a loyal customer 
  * **Frustration**: The header of this section is a bit confusing and has words some people may not understand (Patrons?)
    * **Fix**: Change header for both designs to : “Warm Words from Our Beloved Customers” 
  * **Frustration**: For Design 1, they are a bit too much like the background
    * **Fix**: Change background color for testimonials to a light gray instead of white

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page; also saw hours and location through scrolling

**A/B Testing**

Liked the same layouts, texts, and designs as the previous person 

Also mentioned that it was better to make sure that the design does not have a brown background for a section that is right above the footer, as it creates a weird white gap of nothing between the footer and end of the other brown section

## Second (Updated) Designs Session 3

### Designs Tested
**[Second Figma Designs](Second_Figma_Designs.md)**

### Documentation

**Date**: 12/4

**Name of Who Tested**: Allie He

**Time**: 9:25PM

**5 Second test**

She said the same thing that it was “warm”, “caring”, and “welcoming” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort Cafe” and “Join Our Family”. 

**Think out Loud**

**First Task**: Join the rewards program

* As in the first design, described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and now clicking “join our family”  or “join now” where it brings her to the same sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup”
  * **Fix**: Password not needed and is not known how to be implemented through coding, so it was taken out so the user can just join through email and name
  * **Frustration**: The header title says “Create An Account” for the title of the join now page, but the purpose of the website is to “Join Our Family” rather than create an account. The button for this page also states “Sign up” and it would make more sense for it to say “Join Now” just like the home page’s button says to remind the user they are joining the family
    * **Fix**: Change header title text to “Join Our Family” on sign up page which reminds user of the call to action and is more welcoming and caring; changed the button on this page from “Sign up” to “Join Now” 
  * **Frustration**: When she clicked “sign up” on the sign up page, she did not know whether her information went through because there was no confirmation. She also was confused as to how she is getting her free drink and how her visits will be tracked for another free drink.
    * **Fix**: Add a page with the title “Successfully Joined!” which tells the user they have joined, and states more information about the rewards program: “Enjoy your free coffee! Provide us with your email each time you order and we’ll track your visits. After 10 visits, you'll get another free drink coupon in your inbox to redeem. Tag us on social media to get 50% off!”. It also states “Welcome to the Cottage Comfort Café Rewards Program!” and “Thank you for joining us! Exciting perks and treats await you. Check your inbox for a free coffee coupon - redeem it within a week!” which further explains what the user needs to do. It also has a “Return Home” button for users to return home.
* Also saw the “Join Now” button on the homepage navigation bar where it brings her to the same sign up page
Described when scrolling down the home page how she saw the “Join Our Family” call to action as well, and saw that if she signs up, she can get a free drink within a week

**Second Task**: Learn More about the Community

* She as for the first design, clicked on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where she read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event 
  * **Frustration**: The description for the gardening and food drive events do not describe how a community member can help out; there is the “lend a hand” text stating there is a button, but the button is not there.
    * **Fix**: Fix: Add text stating that you can email or call the coffee shop if you want to help out and will get an email with more information; take away the “lend a hand” text that I forgot to take out when removing the “lend a hand” button 
  * **Frustration**: Not a fan about how when she clicks on a button in the navigation bar, how the words turn bold, showing her she is on the page, but the “Cottage Comfort Cafe” text is also bold in the navigation bar, confusing her.
* She also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when she clicked “Learn More” she would also see the community page
  * **Fix**: Keep the bolded “Cottage Comfort Cafe” text and instead when one clicks on a page, underline that page in the navigation bar so they know the page they are on 

**Third Task**: Check the Menu

* From the landing page, she clicked “See Menu” and it took her to the menu page where she saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below.
* When scrolling down, she saw the “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks; then she clicked the “Full Menu” button
* When looking at the navigation menu, she also saw “Full Menu” as a page

**Fourth Task**: Check Testimonial Reviews

* She scrolled down and looked at the reviews and read them, and saw the people’s profile photos too

**Fifth Task**: Check Hours and Location

* Clicked on Hours and Location in navigation bar and then saw the page and “get directions” button, as well as a map; also saw hours and location through scrolling

She also saw that every page link was able to be seen in the footer, as well as a subscribe section 
* **Frustration**: subscribe section does not work
  * **Fix**:  Remove it because we already have a join now page and change the footer
* **Frustration**: There is also no link to the join our family page or a home link and no contact information for customers who need to contact the coffee shop (for example, about the community service or rewards program)
  * **Fix**: Change footer’s layout so that the navigation links are next to the “Cottage Comfort Cafe” logo but on the right side, and then add contact links below the logo (which will aid in contacting the coffee shop when wanting to participate in community service activities); also added copyright and privacy policy to make it more professional; also added “Join our Family” link in footer to rewards program page
 * **Improvement**: Also added privacy policy page and cookie consent popup with a link to privacy policy and button to “Decline” or “Accept” cookies

**A/B Testing**

* As for the color of the buttons (yellow or purple) on the white background for all pages, she definitely liked the yellow buttons. The purple did not seem to fit well with the archetype or vibe of the website. She also liked the text for Design 1 overall as well (“Join our Family” is more warm than “Join Now”)
* Preferred the text layout and photo for Design 1 better for the “Become Part of Our Family” section of the home page. Design 2 felt less welcoming or community driven and the text separation didn’t look that good. 
* For the testimonials in the home page, she preferred the layout of 3 instead of 4 testimonials. She said 4 feels too crowded but also too orderly like a weird grid
* For the home page’s community section, she preferred design 1’s “nurturing the community” rather than “caring for the community”, as it is less words and looks better. She also likes the bordered button rather than the solid one for “Learn More”
* Layout of Hours and Location section on home page and Hours and Location page is better for Design 1 in her opinion. Having the “Get Directions” on the map allows easy access to seeing directions. 
* For the community page, she definitely likes the Design 1 community page. It aligns more with the design on the home page and looks cleaner to her.
