## Quick SWOT Analysis of other Coffee Shops

### Starbucks

**Strengths**

- Good global market presence: stores everywhere and everyone knows it
- Good credibilty and reliability: known for high quality coffee
- Big budget: can do a lot because of the amount of money it makes and has lots of room for taking opportunities
- Community:promotes diversity and inclusion, and has a good presence with doing community service and hosting events that help those in need
- Loyalty Program: A robust loyalty program that encourages repeat business and rewards customers for their loyalty
- Demonstrates persuasion tactics: reciprocity, scarcity, commitment and consistency, liking and consensus
- Global Brand Recognition: Starbucks is one of the most recognized and respected coffee brands worldwide and has lots of loyal customers
- Strong Global Presence: Extensive global network of stores in diverse markets.
- Innovative Product Development: Regular introduction of new products and seasonal offerings.
- Sustainable Practices: Commitment to sustainability and ethical sourcing, appealing to socially conscious consumers.

**Weaknesses**
- High Prices: Premium pricing can be a barrier for cost-conscious consumers.
- Standardization vs. Localization: Balancing global brand consistency with local market needs can be challenging.
- Overdependence on Beverage Sales: Heavily reliant on beverage sales, making it vulnerable to market changes in this segment.
- Complex Menu: Some customers find the menu options complex and intimidating.

**Opportunities**
- Expansion in Emerging Markets: Potential for growth in developing countries where the coffee culture is emerging.
- Diversification of Food Offerings: Expanding the range of food items can attract a broader customer base.
- Enhanced Digital Experience: Further development of digital ordering, delivery, and personalized marketing.
- Health and Wellness Trends: Catering to increasing consumer interest in healthier, lower-calorie beverage and food options.
- Sustainable and Ethical Initiatives: Strengthening its commitment to sustainability can further enhance its brand image and appeal

**Threats**
- Intense Competition: Faces competition from both high-end coffee shops and lower-priced competitors.
- Economic Downturns: Luxury items like premium coffee are often the first to be cut from consumer budgets during economic downturns.
- Changing Consumer Preferences: Shifts towards home-brewed coffee, especially post-pandemic, could affect in-store sales.
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Dependent on global supply chains for coffee beans, which are susceptible to disruptions.
- Archetype: The explorer archetype also makes it dangerous because changing drinks and menus may create times where customers are not satisfied with changes

Our coffee shop, in order to compete with Starbucks, which will be hard due to its global presence, loyal customer base, big budget, and credibilty, will also have many of these aspects. We will also have a rewards program and page that demonstrates our community service, but will make it more prominent and show that we value our community and family very much. We will emphasize the meaning of creating a loyal customer base, and make these people who join our rewards program feel like they are all a part of a big family. We will give constant rewards, and unlike Starbucks, offer a free drink to customers who join our loyalty program (reciprocity), and these customers will have a week to redeem this award (scarcity). We will also promote loyalty even more by giving those who recommend our drinks on social media, 50% off. Our prices will also be cheaper, but also very high quality. We will also show social proof, which is something Starbucks does not show, by clearly showing testimonials and reviews from happy customers, encouraging people to join our family. We will make customers feel more at home, and persuade them to join through photos of happy customers who are a part of this cozy family. We will also encourage people to participate in our community service events. Community service events, a cozy, warm website design layout, happy photos of customers, and a menu of drinks with warm, caring names also provides the persuasion tactic of liking. Starbucks also does not have any happy customers on their website. 

### Dunkin' Donuts

**Strengths**
- Brand Recognition: Dunkin' is a well-established brand with strong recognition, especially in the United States.
- Wide Product Range: Offers a variety of food and beverage options, appealing to a broad customer base.
- Large Network: Extensive network of stores across various locations, enhancing accessibility.
- Affordable Pricing: Generally lower prices compared to specialty coffee shops, attracting cost-conscious consumers.
- Strong Franchise Model: Effective franchising contributes to widespread brand presence and growth.
- Loyalty Program: A robust loyalty program that encourages repeat business.
- Demonstrates persuasion tactics: reciprocity, scarcity, commitment and consistency, liking and consensus

**Weaknesses**
- Dependency on US Market: Over-reliance on the US market makes it vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations.
- Limited Global Presence: Compared to some competitors, Dunkin' has a less extensive international footprint.
- Perception as Lower Quality: The focus on affordability might lead to a perception of lower quality compared to specialty coffee brands.
- Limited Healthier Options: The menu is often criticized for high-calorie, low-nutrient offerings.

**Opportunities**
- Expansion in International Markets: Significant potential for growth in international markets.
- Healthier Menu Options: Growing demand for healthier, more nutritious food and beverage options.
- Digital Integration and Technology: Further leveraging technology for ordering, delivery, and customer engagement.
- Sustainability Initiatives: Increasing consumer interest in sustainability and ethical practices offers a chance to enhance brand image.

**Threats**
- Intense Competition: Faces stiff competition from both global chains and local coffee shops.
- Market Saturation: In some areas, the coffee and fast-food market is highly saturated, limiting growth potential.
- Economic Fluctuations: Vulnerability to economic downturns, which can impact consumer spending on eating out.
- Changing Consumer Preferences: Shifts towards healthier lifestyles and dietary habits can impact demand for traditional menu items.

Our coffee shop, even though it does not have the US presence that Dunkin' Donuts has, it can create a good local community or family better than Dunkin'. It will have a good local presence and bring customers in due to its warm, welcome, and caring tone. The vibe or layout of the store will consist of warm yellows and browns, making customers feel relaxed and at home. The feeling of homeliness will keep them loyal. Dunkin' also has lower-quality coffee in some people's opinions compared to other shops, but is affordable. We want to make sure our coffee is affordable and as high-quality as we can make it. We will also provide more liking compared to Dunkin', by showing our brand archetype clearly and also adding photos on the website of happy customers (which Dunkin' does not provide). We also will provide a link to a community page right in the navigation bar, which Dunkin' does not have, to a clear community service page that shows how much we care for our community and helping out those in need, making us more likeable (and showing we care for people, which Dunkin' does not really show). We will have interesting and warm coffee names, and give off a familial tone, so that everyone who walks in or enters our page feels the welcome and wants to buy from us. We will also emphasize the meaning of creating a loyal customer base, and make these people who join our rewards program feel like they are all a part of a big family, as I stated previously, through reciprocity and scarcity in our rewards. We will also promote loyalty even more by giving those who recommend our drinks on social media, 50% off. Another thing Dunkin' doesn't show is social proof, which we will, again, through testimonials from happy customers, and treat people like family.
