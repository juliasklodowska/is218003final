**Threats**

- Changing Consumer Preferences: Shifts towards home-brewed coffee, especially post-pandemic, could affect in-store sales.
- Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Dependent on global supply chains for coffee beans, which are susceptible to disruptions.
- Archetype: The explorer archetype also makes it dangerous because changing drinks and menus may create times where customers are not satisfied with changes

Our coffee shop, in order to compete with Starbucks, which will be hard due to its global presence, loyal customer base, big budget, and credibilty, will also have many of these aspects. We will also have a rewards program and page that demonstrates our community service, but will make it more prominent and show that we value our community and family very much. We will emphasize the meaning of creating a loyal customer base, and make these people who join our rewards program feel like they are all a part of a big family. We will give constant rewards, and unlike Starbucks, offer a free drink to customers who join our loyalty program (reciprocity), and these customers will have a week to redeem this award (scarcity). We will also promote loyalty even more by giving those who recommend our drinks on social media, 50% off. Our prices will also be cheaper, but also very high quality. We will also show social proof, which is something Starbucks does not show, by clearly showing testimonials and reviews from happy customers, encouraging people to join our family. We will make customers feel more at home, and persuade them to join through photos of happy customers who are a part of this cozy family. We will also encourage people to participate in our community service events. Community service events, a cozy, warm website design layout, happy photos of customers, and a menu of drinks with warm, caring names also provides the persuasion tactic of liking. Starbucks also does not have any happy customers on their website.
