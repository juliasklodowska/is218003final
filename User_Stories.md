## Epic: Emma's Journey (with links to Epics and User Stories)
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **[Awareness](awareness_epic.md)** | Emma searches online and finds our coffee shop's website, which aligns with her ideals of community and relaxation. |
| **[Interest](interest_epic.md)** | The website's design and hero section clearly communicate the coffee shopâ€™s focus on community and relaxation. This aligns with Emma's values of warmth, community, family, comfort and relaxation (liking) as it gives off cozy cottage vibes that nurture and give everyone who comes in a sense of home and belonging. She also sees the "Join our Family" call to action, which gives off a warm tone, where she gets a coffee for free (reciprocity) when signing up and can redeem it in a week (scarcity). She also sees volunteer and community events she can go to and photos of smiling customers (liking).  |
| **[Action](action_epic.md)** | Emma signs up to be apart of the community in order to get her free drink and participates in a community service event.  |
| **[Loyalty](loyalty_epic.md)** | Emma  gets emails frequently telling her after every visit that she is closer to getting a free drink (after 10 visits). She also gets 50% off her order when she recommends the coffee shop on social media, and frequently goes to community service events  |
