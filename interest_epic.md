## Interest Epic

The website's design and hero section clearly communicate the coffee shop’s focus on community and relaxation. This aligns with Emma's values of warmth, community, family, comfort and relaxation (liking) as it gives off cozy cottage vibes that nurture and give everyone who comes in a sense of home and belonging. She also sees the "Join our Family" call to action, which gives off a warm tone, where she gets a coffee for free (reciprocity) when signing up and can redeem it in a week (scarcity). She also sees volunteer and community events she can go to and photos of smiling customers (liking).
