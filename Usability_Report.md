**Introduction**

For my group’s website, we decided to create a coffee shop with the Caregiver brand archetype called “Cottage Comfort Cafe”.  This website would demonstrate persuasion tactics of reciprocity (get a free drink after joining rewards program), scarcity (you only have a week to redeem the free drink), social proof (testimonials), commitment and consistency (after 10 visits, you get another free drink), and liking (community service page). Other pages included would be a location and hours page, join now page, and menu page. This website’s color scheme is also #F5A524 and #312107. Designing the contents of the website took some time, but after 4 testing sessions with 2 people, a user-friendly design was made.

**Session 1**

  On 11/29, I tested my first made design with Allie He at 8:52PM. We started off doing a 5 second test, where she looked at the design for 5 seconds and described feeling “warm” after looking at it. She also said the design held a “caring” tone, and remembered the words “Cottage Comfort” and “Community” from the call to action. Then, I conducted a Think out Loud where she described doing the tasks I gave her. The first task was to join the rewards program. I told her to describe every way she saw to join the rewards program (as there were multiple). First, she described looking at the hero section and clicking the button “join the community” where it brings her to a sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “sign up”. A frustration she had was the Forgot Password and Have an Account buttons don’t take her anywhere, which was fixed by removing these buttons.  She also saw the “Sign Up” button on the homepage where it brings her to the same sign up page as well (that also describes how if she signs up she gets a free drink, gets a free drink after 10 visits, and 50% off if she recommends it on social media). However, she stated that the buttons “Sign Up” and “Join the Community” give the impression that they lead the user to different pages, as the wording of the texts are very different. I fixed this by changing the “Sign Up” button to “Join Now” and changed “Join the Community” to “Join our Family”, especially since another frustration she had was that “Community” in the navigation bar leads the user to the community page, but seems like it would bring the user to the “Join the Community” page (since they both mention community). Changing it to “Join our Family” gets rid of the confusion. Another frustration she had was that the yellow buttons on white background may be hard to see, so I added a drop shadow to them for Design 1, and changed the colors of the buttons for Design 2 to be purple (needs to be tested again to see which option is better). Another fix I made from her frustrations was making the photo in the hero section more transparent so the white text was more readable. 
  
  The second task she did was Learn More about the Community. To do this, she described clicking on the “Community” section of the navigation bar and was brought to the community page where she read about the community service the coffee shop does and saw the food drive event and gardening event where she could “lend a hand” by clicking “lend a hand”. However, she did have issues with the “Lend a Hand” button, as it didn’t bring her anywhere and was not very visible, so I took it out. She also saw from scrolling down the page and seeing “Nurturing the Community” that when she clicked “Learn More” she would also see the community page. The third task she did was check the menu. From the landing page, she clicked “See Menu” and it took her to the menu page where she saw the 8 different speciality drinks and then the regular menu below. When scrolling down, she saw “Community Favorites” and looked at the different drinks, and could click “Full Menu” to go to that page, or just click “Full Menu” on the navigation bar. The fourth task was checking testimonial reviews, which she did by just scrolling and seeing them. The fifth task was checking Hours and Location, which she did by either scrolling down the home page (and seeing location, hours, the map, and directions) or clicking the page on the navigation bar. An issue she had though was the wording was off, since the “Hours and Location” section in the navigation bar is “Location and Hours” when she clicks on the page and when she scrolls down the home page. So, I fixed the text to: “Hours and Location”.
	
 With A/B testing, I was able to get the designs that Allie thought was better and implement that design’s elements into the other design. Overall, she liked the designs, text, and layout from Design 1 the best, but did like the hero section better for the second design where the image spans the whole screen. She liked the hero text: “Welcome to Cottage Comfort Cafe” rather than “Step into Cottage Comfort Cafe” and liked “Where every sip feels like home” rather than “Your Cozy Corner of Warmth and Flavor” (because it is more straightforward and understandable) though from Design 1. She also liked the bolded black navbar elements better from Design 1 because it was more visible, liked the photo of the coffees around the table in the “Join the Community” section of the home page because it shows more community, and preferred all the text in Design 1’s homepage over Design 2 because it felt more welcoming, warm, and simple. She also preferred the first design’s testimonial layout and thought the second design’s background photo took away the attention from the reviews. She also liked the first design for the “Nurturing the Community” section of the homepage because the second design’s layout made the text hard to read due to the colors and background image. The same goes for the hours and location section of the homepage (she liked the first design better). For the Signup Page, she liked the white on white design of the first design, but liked the white input boxes of the second design better (since the yellow ones seemed odd), so I changed both designs to implement these changes. For the menu page, she liked the first design’s layout in regards to the specialty drinks being on the white background rather than a brown background (because the white aligns with the design of the menu in the home page). However, she also liked the second design’s regular menu layout more, as it divided and highlighted sections of the menu better, so I changed the menu page to align with what she preferred.  She also preferred the layout and overall design, text, and photos of the first design for the Community Page.

**Session 2**

On 12/1, I tested the same first unedited design with Eryk Sklodowski at 5:45PM. For the 
5 Second test, he said the website had an “acceptable” and “friendly” tone and he remembered “Welcome to Cottage Comfort”. In the Think out Loud, he did the same tasks as Allie. He went through the same process as her, and described going to basically the same buttons and directions on the home page as her when doing these tasks. He had similar frustrations as her, such as when joining the rewards program, he also got confused with the relation between the “Sign Up” and “Join the Community” buttons (and how they are different from the “Community” button in the navigation bar). A new frustration he had was that the headers of one of the sections state: “Become Part of this Cozy Circle” and “Join Our Cottage Comfort Family”, which is quite long. So, I changed the headers to “Become Part of Our Family”. In the Learn More about the Community task, he also described the invisibility of the “lend a hand” button, which again, I deleted due to it not doing anything anyways. Also, when scrolling down the home page and seeing “Nurturing the Community”, he found its description very long, so I shortened it to: “At Cottage Comfort Café, we're committed to fostering meaningful initiatives that directly support and uplift the people in our community, reflecting the love and care we’ve received from every smiling face that walks through our doors.” 
When doing the check the menu task, he had no issues and just described his process of finding the buttons and pages. In the Check Testimonial Reviews task, he had a few issues. First of all, the reviews didn’t look like reviews from users, but rather quotes; he said they had no personality to them. I fixed this by changing the cards to have pictures attached to them to represent profile pictures. With those profile photos are the names of the customers, their reviews, and proof they are a loyal customer. He also said the header of the testimonials is confusing and has words some people may not understand like patrons, so I changed that word to “Customers”. For Design 1, he said the testimonials blend into the background, so I changed the background to be a darker color.  He had no issues with the Hours and Location task. 
  
When doing A/B Testing with Eryk, he had the same preferences as Allie. He did mention when looking at the layouts to make sure that sections of the design do not have brown backgrounds when above the footer, as it is brown and creates an odd white gap between them.
Then, after I tested the 2 designs with 2 people and got feedback of what they liked between the 2 designs and what they did not like, I updated the 2 designs to their preferences. I also updated the designs to get rid of their previous frustrations in which they either both had about the designs, or that one of them had. 

**Session 3**

After that, I tested both updated designs on 12/4 with Allie He at 9:25PM to see how she liked the designs compared to the previous designs, and whether there were any new frustrations she may have as a user. I did the 5 Second test again to make sure the tone of the website was still caring, welcoming, warm, and gave a sense of family and community. She said the same thing that it was “warm”, “caring”, and “welcoming” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort Cafe” and “Join Our Family”, which was good. Next, I did a think out loud with her where she described going through each task the same way as in the first session with the first designs. For the first task, she described looking at the hero section , seeing the image and buttons and now clicking “join our family”  or “join now” where it brings her to the same sign up page where she inputs name, email, and password and then clicks accept terms and conditions and “signup”. I also noticed that since the password input is not able to be implemented through coding, I would just remove it and the user can just join through email and name. One frustration she had here though was that the header title says “Create An Account” for the title of the join now page, but the purpose of the website is to “Join Our Family” rather than create an account. The button for this page also states “Sign up” and it would make more sense for it to say “Join Now” just like the home page’s button says to remind the user they are joining the family. I fixed this by changing the header title text to “Join Our Family” on the sign up page which reminds the user of the call to action and changed the button on this page from “Sign up” to “Join Now”. She also had an issue when she clicked “sign up” on the sign up page. She did not know whether her information went through because there was no confirmation. She also was confused as to how she is getting her free drink and how her visits will be tracked for another free drink. To fix this I added a page with the title “Successfully Joined!” which tells the user they have joined, and states more information about the rewards program: “Enjoy your free coffee! Provide us with your email each time you order and we’ll track your visits. After 10 visits, you'll get another free drink coupon in your inbox to redeem. Tag us on social media to get 50% off!”. It also states “Welcome to the Cottage Comfort Café Rewards Program!” and “Thank you for joining us! Exciting perks and treats await you. Check your inbox for a free coffee coupon - redeem it within a week!” which further explains what the user needs to do. It also has a “Return Home” button for users to return home. 
  
For the Learn More about the Community task, she navigated to it the same way as in the first session, but did not like how  the description for the gardening and food drive events in the community page do not describe how a community member can help out and there is the “lend a hand” text stating there is a button, but the button is not there. I fixed this by fixing the text to state that you can email or call the coffee shop if you want to help out. She also did not like the layout of the navigation bar, since the title of the coffee shop and page one is on were both bolded, making it confusing. To fix this I made the page one is on in the navigation bar underlined. For the menu and checking hours and location tasks, she navigated the same way as in session 1, and for the testimonials task, she liked the updated design with people’s profiles. As for the footer, she did have a frustration about the subscribe section not working and there not being a link for contact information (if someone needs to contact the shop about the rewards program or participating in an event) or joining the family. I deleted the subscribe section and added a link to “Join our Family”, the “Privacy Policy”, and contact information (email, phone, Twitter, Instagram). I also added copyright and added a privacy page (which includes information about how information is collected and used (plus why)) and cookie consent popup (with a link to the privacy policy and button to “Decline” or “Accept” cookies). For A / B testing, Allie preferred the layout of the first updated design and text better than the second because it was simpler and better to look at.
  
**Session 4**

Then, I tested the updated designs with Eryk Sklodowski again (on 12/7 at 7:23PM) to see if he had any additional input on the updated designs (other than what Allie had). For the 5 Second test, he still stated the website to feel “friendly and acceptable” and also said it felt “welcoming” and remembered the name “Cottage Comfort Cafe” and “Join our Family”. He stated to go through the tasks of the Think out Loud similarly to Allie, but did have an issue with the hero text, and said it looked a bit boring and not inspirational, and didn’t pull the customer in as much as it should. He needed to see and read something that would make him want to stay on the page and click the call to action. So, what I did was change the description to: “Home in Every Sip - Free Drink Upon Joining!” so that the user wants to “Join Our Family”. He also stated the frustration of when clicking “sign up” on the sign up page, he did not know whether the information went through because there was no confirmation, which was the same frustration as Allie. Another frustration he had was that the photo for the join our family section didn’t really give a tone of family and community. He needed to see social proof of people who went to the coffee shop and were happy or joined the rewards program and were happy. Seeing this would also make him happy, especially in the “Become Part of our Family” section of the home page. If he saw a photo with proof that people were happy to join, he would be more inclined to stay on the site and also click “Join our Family”. So, I changed the photo in that section from objects to a photo of a group of happy people a part of the cafe family.  He had the same issue in the second task with contacting the cafe about community service, but for the third task (check the menu), he had issues with the “See Menu” button being a bit unclear (so I made it thicker and clearer). Going along with the social proof frustration he had, I also added profile photos in the testimonial section to be more of happier people smiling because they love the coffee shop. Finally, he just had a frustration with the lengths of text in the whole website. Sections were wordy and became boring and hard to read all the way through, so I changed the text (in the Testimonial names, Nurturing the Community in home page, Become Part of Our Family in home page, Create an Account page text description, Community page description and event descriptions, and menu names for the drinks) to be more shorter and straight to the point. Again for A/B testing, he preferred design 1 as well. 

**Conclusion**

Overall, testing definitely helped me figure out what I needed to add and take away from my design and helped me figure out what was best for the user, and what text, design, or layout would keep the user more engaged and interested to stay on the website. Without testing, I would not be able to make the design that I now have, and wouldn’t be able to know the issues or frustrations parts of my design caused in the beginning.
